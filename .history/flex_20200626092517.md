# The Ultimate Flexbox Guide

So, Why Flexbox? You may ask!
Well, for vertical centering, I may answer!

Can you do it easily? Vertically centering!

Here's a way without flexbox:

```css
center {
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

The above methods works cause the property `translate` uses element's size, and not document's.
How do I know that? Oh, I found it somewhere sometime ago.

So, let's get back to:

1. Why flexbox?
2. What it is?
3. Terminology
4. How to use it?

## Why Flexbox?

The first one I'd like to say is that it's really, really easy to use and very faithful.
It will make sure, it doesn't do anything stupid!

It's supported well in Cross Browsers

- Chrome 29+
- Firefox 28+
- Internet Explorer 11+
- Opera 17+
- Safari 6.1+ (prefixed with -webkit-)
- Android 4.4+
- iOS 7.1+ (prefixed with -webkit-)

### Why use it?

Well, MDN says:

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

You'll see just in a few minutes, And I swear when you've learned it! Your life will become much easier as a Frontend Dev.

Let's Begin!

## What is it, this flexbox thing?

Flexbox is a CSS module(or tool) that only helps you in laying out largely 1D structures easily and with simplicity.

Average Joe: _yells_ **Only 1D won't help me!** _closes the tab_.

Don't be him! Instead, Listen to me and learn flexbox!

Flexbox have row and column properties, which helps you select inline or block directions(As defined in Document Flow).

They have `justify-items` and `align-items` properties which aligns items across different axis, and with different configs.

I'm in total love with flexbox, I've started using it everywhere, I use it wherever I can, It's made by Heaven's for us devs.

## Terminology

Let's show some good use cases and common terminology.

Do remember many of flexbox properties are meant to be set on the parent and some for children.

- **Parent & Children**: To make an element flex container, apply `display: flex` to it.
  Any children that this container has, will now be called `flex-items`.
- **Main Axis**: Main axis of a flex box is the axis along which the items are laid, as we saw earlier that flexbox is 2D. It depends on the `flex-direction` property.
- **Cross Axis**: The axis perpendicular to the main axis, i.e, 90 deg to the main axis. This axis depends on the main axis for its direction.
- **Width & Height**: The width and height of a flex container are simply set by `width` and `height` css props on the flexbox.

That's almost it for terminology, Let's see how its used, shall we?

## How to use it?

We have to break the usage section down in two parts as some properties are meant to be applied on the parent and some are for children.

### Properties for Parent, i.e, Using Flexbox Part-1

All these properties needs to be applied to the parent, flexbox that is.
We saw above how to make a container a flexbox by applying `display: flex` to it!
It's children are then, by default flex-items.

#### flex-direction

This property defines the direction of the main-axis. It is the axis along which all the children will be laid out according to the configurations provided through other props.

```css
flex-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse;
```

![Flex Direction](./img/flex-direction.png ":size=x200")

- **row**: This is the default flex-direction. It lays children from left to right in _ltr_ and inverse in _rtl_.
- **column**: Lays children from top to bottom.
- **row-reverse**: This lays children from right to left in _ltr_ and inverse in _rtl_.
- **column-reverse**: Lays children from bottom to top.

#### justify-content

This defines the alignment of children along the main axis. There are several values and can be used as:

```css
justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around |
  space-evenly;
```

These are the most used properties, there are some others like `start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe`, to know more about them head over [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content).

![Justify Content](./img/justify-content.png)

- **flex-start**: Items are towards the start of the flex-box along the main axis i.e, `flex-direction`.
- **flex-end**: Items are towards the end of the flex-box along the main axis i.e, `flex-direction`.
- **center**: Items are centered along the main-axis i.e, `flex-direction`.
- **space-between**: The total space is divided such that first and last element are on the start and the end of the box, others have space evenly distributed between them, all along the main axis.(More clear in image.)
- **space-around**: All items have 1 unit of space around them, which makes space between any two children 2 units. And 1 unit of space between edge of container and (first, last) child.

The image above makes these props way easier to understand. Don't worry we'lll cover them all, practically, with tutorials and examples in the end.

#### align-items

This defines the alignment of children along the cross axis. There are several values and can be used as:

```css
align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch | baseline;
```

Align Items works on the current line. As per my understanding this applies to items in a single row. It'll take all the rows together and align them as you asked to.

Again there are other values, but these are most used once.(Google them later on!)

![Align Items](./img/align-items.png)

- **flex-start**: Items are aligned at the start of the cross-axis i.e, perpendicular to `flex-direction`.
- **flex-end**: Items are aligned at the end of the cross-axis i.e, perpendicular to `flex-direction`.
- **center**: Items are aligned at the center of the cross-axis.
- **stretch**: Items stretch to fill the container along the cross axis! (But they still remember the min & max-height.)
- **baseline**: Items are aligned in a way so that their baselines aligned along the cross-axis. Baseline is the line at which the text is aligned. <u>The line below this can be taken as baseline.</u>.

Again, the image makes it a lot easier to understand.

#### align-content

Similar to `justify-content` property, but this one works along the cross axis.

```css
align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around |
  space-evenly | stretch;
```

**Note**: This property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items. (Just for understading purposes) Cause it takes a row as a child and then behaves the same as `justify-content`.

Please, Google other values, if you need to. I really love this one picture for align-content by [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

![Align Content](./img/align-content.svg ":size=x400")

- **flex-start**: Rows are towards the start of the flex-box along the cross axis.
- **flex-end**: Rows are towards the end of the flex-box along the cross axis.
- **center**: Rows are centered along the cross-axis.
- **space-between**: The total space is divided such that first and last row are on the start and the end of the box, others have space evenly distributed between them, all along the cross axis.(More clear in image.)
- **space-around**: All rows have 1 unit of space around them, which makes space between any two rows 2 units. And 1 unit of space between edge of container and (first, last) row.
- **stretch**: Rows are strecthed to fill the whole space container has along the cross axis.(Clear in the picture!)

#### flex-wrap

Flex items try to fit in a single line, by default. You can allow items to wrap as per the width of container and content itself.

```css
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
```

![Flex Wrap](./img/flex-wrap.png)

The values of this property are clear by para above and the image itself, I think.

#### flex-flow

Just a shorter way to write `flex-direction` & `flex-wrap` properties together.

```css
flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap;
```

These are both values.

**So that's about it for parent properties in flexbox. Let see what it has for children!**

### Properties for Children, i.e, Using Flexbox Part-2

These properties only work on children of a flexbox. The child can be a flexbox. & that is what gives flexbox power.
You don't need to apply any property for a element to be flex-item, It's done by default when you assign 'display: flex` to it's parent.

?> Also, note that `float`, `clear` and `vertical-align` have no effect on flex-item.

So, let's get into it!

#### order

By default elements are laid out in the order as discussed in the document flow, or we can say in the order of source code.
By specifying the `order` property, we can control the order in which elemens appear in the flex container.

```css
order: 3; /* default is 0 */
```

![Flex Children Order](./img/order.svg)

Do remember **negative order puts element to the start**.

#### align-self

Align self property on a child allows us to override it's default alignment or the alignment specified by the `align-items`.
Values are same as [align-items](/flex?id=align-items).

```css
align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
```

![Align Self property](img/align-selg.png)

#### flex-basis

This property sets initial main size of a flex-item, or to be more clear it sets the size of content box unless otherwise set with `box-sizing`.

!> No negative values and not supported in all browsers yet!

```css
flex-basis: width | auto; /* auto by default */
/* width in case of flex-direction: row, height in flex-direction: column! */
/* Also, this propert has priority over width or height property set on the element. */
```

![Flex Basis property](img/flex-basis.png)

#### flex-grow

When not applied, it defaults to 1. When applied it defines the proportion in which a flex item expands relative to other items(If there is space available for that).

So, let's say you have `flex-grow: 2`, so this item will expand twice as fast as compared to items with no `flex-grow` or `flex-grow: 1`.

!> Can't be negative!

```css
flex-grow: n; /* n is a integer. */
```

![Flex Grow property](img/flex-grow.png ":size=x150")

#### flex-shrink

This is similar but inverse of flex-grow. It tells flex how much to shrink this child when there is not enough space available.

So, this property defines the proportion in which a flex item shrinks more than other items in that container.

!> Again, this one can't be negative.

```css
flex-shrink: n;
```

#### flex

Shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` & `flex-basis`.

?> Default: `0 1 auto`

```css
flex: none | < "flex-grow" > < "flex-shrink" > < "flex-basis" >;
```

`flex-shrink` & `flex-basis` **are optional**.

As [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) says:
**It is recommended that you use this shorthand property** rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.

This ends our flexbox module, I hope this post helps in some way or other.
We'll be creating some practical things, most probably headers and stuff to show how flex can be used?

### Resources

Here are some high-end resources:

- [W3C Candidate Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#propdef-flex-shrink)
- [MDN Flexbox Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout)

Next we'll be looking at the most important thing in CSS(my view), i.e, Positioning!
