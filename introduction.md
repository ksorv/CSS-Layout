# Introduction

It's just been days since I started doing productive things and Here I'm creating this course. People asked for it on my beginner post. So, here it is.

## What is this course?

Now, Let's talk about this course. I'm focusing on **Beginners** and even **Intermediate** developers who want to learn layouts.

I know you don't need to learn it cause there are like a gazillion frameworks which will give you pre-built stuff, but The difference comes when you want your sites to load faster. You want less **complexity**.

### How does it help?

When you know how to create layouts, you can create stuff for yourself or for your company(most of them uses framworks tho).

But you'll see that JAMStack is rising faster than you know and think. And using plain CSS there is much better cause it reduces the file-sizes by many folds.

And I think there is nothing better than that.

## How I'm thinking to teach?(Feedbacks required)

I've devided this mini-course into 7 lessons(not including this one).

Each one has it's purpose which it should fill to help me teach you better.

I choose this platform as It gives me all this setup and also provide the course for FREE if i ask.

We'll start with Normal document flow, and then we'll conver floats, positioning and then taking you to Grids and Flexboxes.

Now, Grids and Flexbox are pretty big topics. I'll try to conver them in it but if I can't then again you'll get another banger in following days.

That's about it! Let's do this.
